    "So our objective here is to answer the question: Can we build a machine learning model that can accurately predict if a borrower will pay off their loan on time or not? \n",
    "The approach we will choose here is we will model this problem as a binary classification problem, where 0 means the borrower doesn't pay back on time and 1 meaning the borrower does pay on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to find an error metric, an error metric will tell us how our alogirthm is performing and how we can improve it.\n",
    "Our objective in this is to make money -- we want to fund enough loans that are paid off on time to offset our losses from loans that aren't paid off. An error metric will help us determine if our algorithm will make us money or lose us money.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're primarily concerned with false positives and false negatives. Both of these are different types of misclassifications. With a false positive, we predict that a loan will be paid off on time, but it actually isn't. This costs us money, since we fund loans that lose us money. With a false negative, we predict that a loan won't be paid off on time, but it actually would be paid off on time. This loses us potential money, since we didn't fund a loan that actually would have been paid off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we're viewing this problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor, we need to treat false positives differently than false negatives. A conservative investor would want to minimize risk, and avoid false positives as much as possible. It's better to miss an opportunity (false negatives) than funding a risky loan (false positives).\n",
    "\n",
    "let's say we've correctly identified loan_status in 85.7% of cases. However, we've done this by predicting 1 for every row. What this means is that we'll actually lose money. Let's say we loan out 1000 dollars on average to each borrower. Each borrower pays us 10% interest back. So we make a projected profit of 100 dollars on each loan. But we lose 1000 on one. Therefore we lose money.\n",
